Possible ideas

If we want the buyer to leave a review for a request in a listing...
then we have to make it so the seller can have a way to accept that request through listing or some other model?

then somehow make a method to make it so the request can be removed from the listing and then be transfered to the service with that seller_id?

this way then the buyer will be able to have an option to create a review for that request that the seller completed
